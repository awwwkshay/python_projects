# Web_mapping_United_States_Volcanoes

Created a python ipynb file to map various volcanoes in United States on a map including their Elevation and hyperlinked name for easy search on Google.
Got the data for the volcanoes from volcanoes.txt which is a comma-separated file including various attributes including Name, Elevation, Latitude, Longitude etc.
Have also included the html file for seeing the map in a browser.
