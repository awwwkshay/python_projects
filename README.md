# Web_mapping_United_States_Volcanoes

Created a python ipynb file to map various volcanoes in United States including their Elevation and hyperlinked name for easy search on Google and population of different countries based on 2005 data on world map.
Got the data for the volcanoes online, saved in volcanoes.txt which is a comma-separated file including various attributes including Name, Elevation, Latitude, Longitude etc.
Data for various countries' population imported from world.json file which is used for creating polygonal areas on the map.

Created layer control for the volcanoes and population so can turn on/off the layers as per requirement.

Included the html file for opening the map in a browser.
